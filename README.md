## Quick Summary

I've been using TikTok daily since 2022. Over the past 6 months, I've noticed my feed getting repetitive. This case study is my attempt to understand why and propose a solution.

**The core problem:** TikTok's algorithm creates repetitive content instead of discovery related contents.

## 1. The Problem

When I watch astrology videos now, I only get more astrology. But back in 2023, I'd also get:
- Numerology
- Spirituality talks  
- Personality psychology
- Self-development content

Now it's just variations of the same thing. I get bored after a couple of videos with the same subject.

### What users are saying (from Reddit/Twitter):
- "My For You page is stuck on one topic"
- "I have to search manually to find new things"
- "TikTok used to read my mind, now it just repeats itself"

---

## 2. Why Should TikTok Care?

1. **Bored users leave** - If I get bored, I close the app
2. **Discovery = Competitive advantage** - This is what made TikTok special
3. **Long-term > Short-term** - Immediate engagement vs lasting satisfaction

---

## 3. My Hypothesis (Educated Guesses)

I think the algorithm might be:

1. **Too focused on hashtags** - Same tags = same content loop
2. **Prioritizing quick wins** - Showing what you'll definitely like vs what you might discover
3. **Missing semantic connections** - Not seeing that "astrology" and "numerology" are related worlds
4. **Playing it too safe** - Fewer experimental recommendations

---

## 4. My Proposed Fix: "Smart Adjacent Discovery"

### Simple idea:
If someone likes **Astrology**, also show them:
- Numerology (related practice)
- Personality systems (MBTI, Enneagram)
- Spiritual psychology
- Symbolism & mythology

### How it could work:
1. Map main interests to 3-5 related topics
2. Test these with small user groups
3. If engagement is good, expand gradually
4. Always keep relevance high

## 5. How We'd Know It's Working

| What to measure | Why it matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Do people watch adjacent content?** | Shows if the connections make sense |
| **Do sessions get longer?** | More discovery = more time in app |
| **Do people search less?** | Algorithm is doing the discovery work |
| **Do they click "Not Interested" less?** | Less content fatigue |

## 6. Risks & Real Talk

### What could go wrong:
- **Showing irrelevant stuff** - Worst case: people get annoyed
- **Technical complexity** - Might need more computing power
- **Business pressure** - "Just keep engagement high this quarter"

### How to avoid problems:
- Start small (5% of users)
- Only show highly related content first
- Have an "undo" button ready

---

## 7. Why I'm Thinking About This

As someone who wants to work in product:

1. **I notice product problems** in my daily life
2. **I try to understand the "why"** behind them
3. **I think about solutions** that balance user needs and business goals
4. **I care about the details** - not just "make it better" but "how exactly"

This case study is me practicing that mindset.

---

## 8. What I'd Do Next (If This Were My Project)

1. **Talk to actual TikTok users** - Are others feeling this too?
2. **Look at the data** - How widespread is this "echo chamber" effect?
3. **Prototype the adjacency mapping** - Start with 20 main categories
4. **Propose a 1% test** - Safest way to learn

---

## Final Thoughts

TikTok changed how we discover content. But algorithms need tuning. This is my take on one tuning that could help.

It's not about knowing all the answers—it's about asking the right questions and thinking through solutions.
